# Data-Structures

AIM : 
           The aim of our project is to create a Bus Reservation System for employees working at bus depots to book and reserve tickets for customers.

OBJECTIVES :
●	       To make us more comfortable in using the data structures concept to create different applications.
●	        Data Structures used:Class,Array
●	        Class is used to hold the main functions and variables used throughout the code.
●	         Array is used to store and access the data ,the array is linked with the class.

METHODOLOGY : 
❖	The Bus Reservation System's characteristics are put into a class that is constructed.
❖	Users can upload bus-related data such as the bus number and driver's name.
❖	Additionally, it is quite simple because the reservation is made in the passenger's name.
❖	This was produced with the aid of the C++ programming language.
❖	It's easy to use and understand.
❖	The system also shows all relevant details on the buses and the assigned seats.
❖	The buses that can be reserved are also shown using this system.


FUNCTIONS USED : 
1) Adds a new bus with the void add bus details() method.
2) void allotment(): Assigns a passenger a seat.
3) void empty() : Used to indicate that every bus seat is unoccupied.
4) void show() : Displays the bus's available seats.
5) void avail() : displays buses that are available
6) void position(int i) : Displays bus seats with reservations
7) int main() : Used to call every function and neatly display the output.
8) void vline() : Dummy method used to divide and clean the output by adding lines of "*"


CONTRIBUTIONS : 
         The idea of booking bus seats in advance is the foundation of the Simple Bus Reservation System. I have researched, corrected the code, and given the team members the preference for several functions. Making PPTs and individual documents for the FISAC project is the main task I completed.
